# Security Policy

## Reporting

If you discover a potential vulnerability or sensitive data exposure, please email security@example.com with a short description and steps to reproduce.

## Scope

This repository only hosts documentation and media assets for demos; there are no deployed services or runtime components. Security reports should focus on exposed secrets, personally identifiable information in media, or documentation issues that could mislead users.
