This gallery highlights representative trajectory and biophysics recordings with inline previews and downloadable media.

- ``bacteria_3d_motion`` — swimming bacteria tracks rendered in three dimensions to show helical drift and tumble patterns.
- ``nanorod_membrane`` — anisotropic nanorods interacting with a lipid membrane, emphasizing bending and adhesion dynamics.
- ``cdv_correlated_displacement`` — correlated displacement vectors from a collective motion experiment, useful for teaching microrheology concepts.
